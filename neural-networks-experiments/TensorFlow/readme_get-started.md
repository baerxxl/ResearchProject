# Getting started with TensorFlow

This document introduces the TensorFlow programming environment and shows you how to solve the Iris classification problem in TensorFlow.


Prior to using the sample code in this document, you'll need to do the following:

1. Install TensorFlow, look for a manual [here](https://github.com/sagr4019/ResearchProject/blob/master/Examples/TensorFlow/readme_installation.md).

2. Install or upgrade pandas by issuing the following command:
`pip install pandas`

3. Getting the sample source code:
 * Clone the TensorFlow Models repository from GitHub by entering the following command:
   `git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models`, or download it manually.
   Change directory within that branch to the location containing the examples used in this document:
  * Go into the following folder: `cd models/samples/core/get_started/`
    The program described in this document is premade_estimator.py. This program uses iris_data.py to fetch its training data.

4. Run the program premade_estimator.py and see the results.
