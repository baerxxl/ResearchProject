This document introduces the TensorFlow programming environment and shows you how to solve the Iris classification problem in TensorFlow.


Prior to using the sample code in this document, you'll need to do the following:

Install TensorFlow.
If you installed TensorFlow with virtualenv or Anaconda, activate your TensorFlow environment.
Install or upgrade pandas by issuing the following command:

pip install pandas
Getting the sample code
Take the following steps to get the sample code we'll be going through:

Clone the TensorFlow Models repository from GitHub by entering the following command:

git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models
Change directory within that branch to the location containing the examples used in this document:

cd models/samples/core/get_started/
The program described in this document is premade_estimator.py. This program uses iris_data.py to fetch its training data.

Running the program
You run TensorFlow programs as you would run any Python program. For example:

start it with :python premade_estimator.py and see the results.
